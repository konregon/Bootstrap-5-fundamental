                Making music isn’t easy. It takes time, effort, and learning. But when
                you’re in the flow, it’s incredibly rewarding.
            </h3>
            <p>
                We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force
                behind Ableton is our passion for what we make, and the people we make
                it for.

            <p>
                Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use
                Live and Push every day. We come from a wide range of cultural and
                professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught,
                and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared
                belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to
                something big: helping to shape the future of music culture.

            <p>
                Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our
                people what they need to work their magic and grow. We’ve learned that
                achieving the best results comes from building teams that are richly
                diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of
                perspectives. We don’t always agree with each other, but opinion and
                debate are valued and openly encouraged.

            <p>
                We work hard to foster an environment where people can grow both

                Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported
                in acquiring new knowledge and skills, and coached on applying these in
                their daily work. In addition, staff-organized development and music
                salons are a chance to discuss new technologies, production techniques
                and best practices.

                Plus, working in Germany means you can expect comprehensive health
                insurance for you and your family, as well as generous maternity and
                paternity leave. Office hours are flexible, but it’s not all work; we
                have several company and team outings throughout the year as well as a
